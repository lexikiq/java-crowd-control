A Java library for interacting with a [crowdcontrol.live](https://crowdcontrol.live) server
or clients. The library abstracts away the logic involved in communicating with clients
allowing you to quickly and easily develop new effect packs without having to worry about
complicated networking protocols. Various helpful utilities are included, such as a
manager for timed effects which prevents two of the same effect from running at the same time.

## Usage

Detailed instructions for how to use this Java library are available 
[**here**](https://github.com/qixils/java-crowd-control/blob/master/USAGE.md).
